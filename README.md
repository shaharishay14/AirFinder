# AirFinder
Hello! I'm Shahar, a dedicated computer science student with a passion for problem-solving and innovation. Welcome to AirFinder, a project I developed as part of my educational journey. My aim was to create something practical and helpful, leveraging my skills to make a difference.

AirFinder was born from the desire to simplify the process of finding the best Airbnb listings. I understand how time-consuming and frustrating it can be to search through countless listings to find the perfect place at the best price. My goal with AirFinder is to save you both time and money by providing a streamlined and efficient way to discover the best deals on Airbnb.

This project has been an incredible learning experience for me, and I'm excited to share it with you. I hope you find AirFinder to be a valuable tool in your travel planning, making your journey smoother and more affordable. Thank you for visiting, and happy travels!
